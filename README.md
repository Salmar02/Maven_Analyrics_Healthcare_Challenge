# When care meets cure : Maven Analytics Healthcare Challenge

This project falls into the **Maven Healthcare Challenge** where we'll be working as Data Analysts for the American Hospital Association (AHA), a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients, and acts as a source of information on health care issues and trends.

The task is to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years. The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".
